Introduction                                                    *NCRIntroduction*

The non-continuous-range plugin allows you to execute arbitrary Ex expressions
on arbitrary lines in the open buffer. You can select the lines visually, or by
using a range string |ncrrangestr| directly in the command line.

All non-continuous-range commands start with the letters 'NCR'.

This plugin requires vim9script support, but this doesn't necessarily mean you
need vim9. In some distributions where vim8 is the most recent version, vim has
been compiled with vim9script support. This plugin aims to support these
versions.

non-continuous-range exposes the following commands:

                                                                     *:NCRAppend*
:NCRAppend          Append the current line to the line selection.

:[range]NCRAppend   Append [range] lines to the line selection.

                                                                   *:NCRSubtract*
:NCRSubtract        Remove the current line from the line selection.

:[range]NCRSubtract Remove [range] lines from the line selection.

                                                                      *:NCRClear*
:NCRClear           Remove all lines from the line selection.

                                                             *:NCRExeOnSelection*
:NCRExeOnSelection {expr}
                    Execute {expr} on the line selection. {expr} may be any
                    valid `:execute` expression.

                    The plugin will execute {expr} on every line in the line
                    selection individually, starting from the highest line
                    number and going down.

                                                                 *:NCRExeOnRange*
:NCRExeOnRange {|ncrrangestr|} {expr}
                    Execute {expr} on the lines defined by {ncrrangestr}. 
                    {expr} may be any valid `:execute` expression.

                    See |ncrrangestr| for valid range string formatting.

                    The plugin will execute {expr} on every line in the line
                    selection individually, starting from the highest line

:NCRRestore         Restore the most recent line selection. This command
                    restores selections cleared by |:NCRClear| and both
                    execute commands.

                                                                       *:NCRShow*

Miscellaneous

                                                                    *ncrrangestr*
{ncrrangestr}       A range string. Range strings are comma-separated elements
                    which can either be a plain integer (representing a single
                    line), or two numbers separated by a dash (representing a
                    line range).

                    For example, {rangestr} 1,4-7 would represent lines 1, 4,
                    5, 6, and 7.
